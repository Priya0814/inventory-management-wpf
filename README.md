# inventory-management
This repository contains a WPF application designed to help people manage their inventory better. This was a team project of 3 people including myself.

It offers the user many options for managing their inventory:

1. Creating an item.
2. Updating and deleting an item.
3. Searching for an item.
4. Loading a preset of items from a file (like a spreadsheet).
5. Saving the inventory items list to a file to load them later.
6. Updating item quantities with easily accessible buttons.
7. Generating a report of all items with minimum and available quantities.
8. Generating a shopping list for items that need to be purchased.

All of this functionality is packaged in a colorful and user-friendly design using WPF.

This website is coded using C# & .NET WPF.

## How to run the application

Simply open the solution file in Visual Studio or run the executable file.
